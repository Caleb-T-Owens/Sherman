In the last year and a half, I've gone from being an end-user of git to
implementing novel algorithms with three way merges. I've been very fortunate
with all of the guidance around me. From the first time I sat down with Scott
and he introduced me to the concept to all the rich resources and acedemic
research, it's been a wonderful space to explore.

I'm still discovering new ideas about merges, but recently I found a model that
I really quite like and thought I'd share!

## Why I care about having a good way of describing merges

My style of development is to first start with a theoretical model either in my
mind or on paper that I then write into code and then test to assert it behaves
as expected.

When I first started working with merges, I would just simulate the operation in
it's entirity in my mind in an almost brute force fashion. This is obviously not
efficient. In the same way we use numbers as an astraction over having little piles of stones of differing quantities, having the ability to write expressions with three way merges
