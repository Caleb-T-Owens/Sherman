# <dfn>Magpie's Nest</dfn>

[Magpie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie)'s are often
attributed to
[collecting shiny objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie#Europe), and having messy nests. As such, if I were to describe something as a
magpie's nest, I would mean that it is a messy collection of various
curious, shiny objects. This however seems slightly juxtaposed to more
typical usage. Firstly, searching on the internet, I've found that the term
is not as popular as I thought. Collins dictionary lists that "magpie" can
be used as a term to describe a person who likes hoarding items of small
value
[(ref)](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/magpie), and other sources seem to put more emphasis on a "magpie's nest" being
full of stolen objects.

Humorously enough,
[one study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-014-0794-4#auth-T__V_-Shephard-Aff1)
from Exeter University which looked at a small sample of
[eurasian magpies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_magpie)
(pica pica), indicated that the the eurasian magpies didn't have any
particular affinity to shiny objects, and in fact recorded a hesitancy to
eat in the presence of shiny objects. The myth of magpies collecting shiny
items is generally attributed to the popular 1821 opera
[La gazza ladra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_gazza_ladra)
(The Thieving Magpie)

The magpie is supposed to be described on pages 666 to 672 in volume 3 of
[Historia animalium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_animalium_(Gessner_book)), a book printed in 1555 by Conard Gessner. I very much enjoy reading old
books and what they have to say about things, but alas, I cannot read nor
write Latin. Unfortunately,
[Topsell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Topsell) left out
the birds in his "The History of Four-Footed Beasts and Serpents", which
drew strongly on the works of Gessner. If you can translate, or know of a
translation, I would be incredibly keen to hear from you. Please send me an
