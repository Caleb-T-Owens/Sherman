# Phrases

<LastUpdated filePath="src/pages/phrases/index.mdx" />

There are occasionally times where I will use a
[term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology) or
[phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase) that is local to where I grew up,
or one that I have found for some inexplicable reason. I thought I'd write some
of them down, if there are no good references that I can find elsewhere.
