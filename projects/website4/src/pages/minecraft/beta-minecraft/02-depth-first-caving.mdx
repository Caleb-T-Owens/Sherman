# Depth First Caving

Whether it's beta Minecraft or the latest version, the first day in your world
is almost identical. I started my world off in my usual fashion by punching a
tree to get three logs, craft a wooden pickaxe, gather 3 stone to make a stone
pickaxe, and then gather 3 more to make a stone axe. Then I gathered some more
wood for a bed and a door, dispatched some sheep, and put together a small
cliff-side home to use as a base for the next few days in the game.
