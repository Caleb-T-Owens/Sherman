# Projects

A list of stuff I've worked on. Often they're not particularly useful or really
production ready, but I enjoy solving small quality of life problems.

## [Patc](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/tree/main/projects/patc)

Status: Useful

Patc is a little CLI tool for cloning and applying patches to a given git
repository.

The reason I built this was to manage the [suckless](https://suckless.org) tools
that I use in debian. Namely [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) and
[st](https://st.suckless.org). These tools are typically configured by applying
`.patch` files on top of their git repository which make code changes to the
project.

Often people will fork and commit these changes, but I'm quite fond of using a
monorepo, so I built `patc` to clone and apply patches stored in a given
configuration. `patc` also has tooling for generating patches from code changes
you've made.

## Empower learn

Status: Work in progress

This is a mathematics learning application that I'm working on. I'm building it
as an [ionic](https://ionicframework.com) [react](https://react.dev) application
with [redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org), with a
[rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) backend.

## [Aptfile](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/tree/main/projects/aptfile)

Status: Useful, but without guardrails

This is a little tool that functions similar to
[`Brewfile`s](https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile) which I use to
manage the packages installed in my debian laptop.

It's a bit more primitive. Currently the `Aptfile` itself is just a long list of
packages, but I would like to expand it to support meta-packages.

## [Project Cloner 2](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/tree/main/projects/project-cloner2)

Status: Useful

This is a little rust program which I use to clone external projects into my
monorepo's `projects` folder.

It reads from a
[`cloned.json`](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/blob/main/projects/cloned.json)
which it iterates over, cloning and adding the projects to the `.gitignore`.

I find this works nicely because I can expect that both my machines will have
the same projects cloned, but I don't have to deal with
[submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) or
[subtrees](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-subtree).

## [Deploy deploy](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/tree/main/projects/deploydeploy)

Status: Useful & in need of a better name

I like to deploy my projects on a miniPC as
[docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) services. This way my
deployed services can have their own databases or whatever other dependencies
they may need.

I _am_ aware of tools like [portainer](https://www.portainer.io), but I do like
the simplicity of having my own deploy scripts that I understand fully.

`deploydeploy` aims to simplify the management of docker compose by having a
folder that contains many sub-folders which represent services. Each service is
defined by a
[`compose.yaml`](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/blob/main/deploy/charm/website4/compose.yaml),
optionally a
[`config.json`](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/blob/main/deploy/charm/website4/config.json)
which lets you define other artifacts relevant to building the project, and
[any other misc files](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/blob/main/deploy/charm/website4/nginx.conf).

It currently has just `up`, `down`, and `status` sub-commands.

I wrote this with the [bun](https://bun.com/docs) ECMAScript runtime making use
of the [shell API](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/shell) which was inspired by
Google's [`zx`](https://google.github.io/zx/) project. It was a good
[devex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Experience), though, I would
want [`.quiet()`](https://bun.com/reference/bun/$/ShellPromise/quiet) to be
applied by default. My
[configset](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/tree/main/configsets/shared/deploydeploy)
for installing `deploydeploy` uses bun's
[standalone executable](https://bun.com/docs/bundler/executables) tooling which
worked well out of the box.

## [Puzzle Planner](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/tree/main/projects/puzzle-planner)

Status: Work in progress

Puzzle Planner is a private leaderboard project written in
[rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails). The main functionality is
in place, but just lacks some scoring mechanisms.

The idea is to create a leaderboard for friends and family which lets you
manually enter your start and finish times - allowing competition to be
asynchronous.

## [Website 4](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/tree/main/projects/project-cloner2)

Status: Useful

My website is often a bit of an experimentation ground that I like to play
around with. I was previously using [Angular](https://angular.dev) to get a feel
for the framework. I really liked Angular, but I wanted to move to something
that let me use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), and [Astro](https://astro.build)
looked nice with its component setup and idea of
["islands of interactivity"](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).

Previous versions can be found
[here](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/tree/main/projects/website3) and
[here](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/website).

## [And much more!](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman)

I never want to lose code, so I always commit my stuff to
[my monorepo](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman) which you can check out.

You can also check out my slightly crazy set of
[makefiles](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)>) that I use to sync
[my computer's configurations](https://github.com/Caleb-T-Owens/Sherman/tree/main/configsets).
