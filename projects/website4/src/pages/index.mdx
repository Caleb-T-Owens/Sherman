# Welcome to my little patch of the internet!

Hey there! I'm Caleb, a houseplant enthusiast, table top RPG player, board
game lover, programmer, and coffee drinker.

If you enjoy any of those things and want to chat, feel free to send me an
email at [hey@intherain.cloud](mailto:hey@intherain.cloud).

## About me

I come from [Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey), not
the [newfangled kind from America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey), but the small island that sits in the [English Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel)
(or "La Manche" as the neighbors would prefer), about 15 miles from
[France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) and 100 miles
from [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England).

I eventually moved to England where I did my
[A-Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-level). It was about
this time I found some friends who introduced me to
[TTRPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game)s. To this day I still play TTRPGs with this group. Over the summer
holiday of my A-Levels I spent two months working at
[The Idea Bureau](https://theideabureau.co/), a small software
agency and gained some of my first professional experience.

After completing my A-Levels, I chose to not go to university and started
working for a wonderful company called
[Storm Consultancy](https://stormconsultancy.co.uk/) where I
learned [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and became a
mid level software engineer. After two years I ended up leaving Storm for
my current job to move to
[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany), working at
[GitButler](https://gitbutler.com/).

## What is this website?

This website can be thought of as a
[magpie's nest](/phrases/magpies-nest). A collection of
things that seem interesting, notes, small projects, and experiments. I
previously had a website which was meant to be some sort of fancy
portfolio for employers or something, but realistically, that had no use
to anyone - including myself! I've also had a growing desire to have a
platform where I can just put stuff out, without participating in
congested social media platforms, so this version of the website was born.

## Keeping content up to date

While I will endeavor to provide accurate and up to date information, I am
unfortunately finite in my capacity. I try to maintain timestamps at the
top of each page so you can gauge how relevant the information still is.

### Spotted a mistake?

If you have spotted a mistake or a broken link, I would be keen to hear
about it. Feel free to contact me at
[corrections@intherain.cloud](mailto:corrections@intherain.cloud).
