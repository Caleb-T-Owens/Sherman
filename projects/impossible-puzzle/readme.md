# "impossible puzzle"

I found a supposedly impossible puzzle on reddit [(see)](https://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/1gxk0uo/my_friend_sent_me_this_impossible_quiz_i_think_it/#lightbox). The puzzle seems rather flawed because depdending on how the rules are determined, they are either completly impossible, or has many many solutions.

I thought it would be mildly humerous to write a little program to enumerate all the results.
