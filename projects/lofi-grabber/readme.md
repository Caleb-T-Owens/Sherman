# Lofi Grabber

This is a tool designed to download the music kindly provided by lofi records
from their offical release on their website.

This script includes built-in delays with the goal of hopfully reducing some of
the load on the lofi girl website.

This tool creates a manifest file in order to avoid downloading the same music
multiple times. Please preserve the manifest in order to avoid exessive load on
the lofi girl website.
