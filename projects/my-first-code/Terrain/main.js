// Id like to have some biomes that are generated using random numbers, id like the biomes to be deep water, water, beach, grass, hills, and mountains.

// I think the way to acheive that is to firstly generate a random number for each pixel that there is on the screen, then there would be a bunch of filters that would run that would be adverageing out the numbers and making sure that deep water was near water and stuff like that. By ordering the biomes in the way I did up there it should figgure out what should be next to eachother naturally when smoothing out the noise.
