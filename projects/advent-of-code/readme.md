# Advent of Code

All my solutions can be run with `./setup.sh && ./run.sh` (in theory).

Advent of Code problems are designed to be solvable in under 15 seconds on what would now be 16 year old hardware. I try to make reasonable solutions that finish in under a second, but I'm also not opposed to making use of high-end hardware to brute force my way through a puzzle that doesn't capture my interest in the moment.

A big thanks to Eric and the other kind folks who make Advent of Code happen. I love high quality puzzles like this, and the story that complements them is just fantastic.
