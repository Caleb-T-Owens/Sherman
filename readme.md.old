# Sherman

This is designed to replace my old shell configuration
[Sherman-the-shell-config](https://github.com/calebowens/Sherman-the-shell-config).

My old setup was getting a little unweildy to maintain because it was just a
bunch of shell scripts... so I've replaced it with a bunch of C code!

This is likly a bad idea, but I've chosen to use C because it can be compiled
after installing the XCode command line tools and nothing else installed.

This means that I should be able to bootstrap a new mac without any trouble...

Update as of the 17th of October. I've started using some "temporary" shell
scripts so I can migrate away from my previous config and start using this.

These shell scripts have more than enough jank to entirly delete your home
directory. You have been warned.

An eventaul goal is to make sherman a framework that anyone can use, but at the
minute its set up specifically for my computer
