# Sherman

This is designed to replace my old shell configuration
[Sherman-the-shell-config](https://github.com/calebowens/Sherman-the-shell-config).

My old setup was getting a little unweildy to maintain because it was just a
bunch of shell scripts... so I've replaced it with a bunch of C code!

This is likly a bad idea, but I've chosen to use C because it can be compiled
after installing the XCode command line tools and nothing else installed.

This means that I should be able to bootstrap a new mac without any trouble...
